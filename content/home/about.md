## Bio

I am currently in my second year of the [Masters in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu/) program at the University of Chicago. My [thesis project](https://github.com/callab/ldp-alignment) involves estimating the effects of linguistic alignment between parents and their children through statistical modeling.

Broadly, I am interested in questions at the intersection of cognitive science and artificial intelligence.
